# American Airlines Flight Delay Analysis - Final Report

## Project Objective

To analyze delay patterns of American Airlines (and American Eagle) using historical flight delay data. The aim is to identify key contributors to delays and provide actionable insights.

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- Python (Pandas, MySQL Connector)
- CSV Dataset (Cleaned)

## Dataset

The dataset includes airline delay data categorized by delay causes (weather, carrier, NAS, etc.), monthly across multiple years.

## Methodology

1. Created database and table schema using SQL.
2. Loaded data from a cleaned CSV file using Python.
3. Executed SQL queries to filter and extract insights specific to American Airlines.
4. Saved visual results (if any) in the output folder.

## Key Findings

- Common causes of delays include late aircraft and weather.
- Seasonal and monthly trends were observed.
- Carrier-specific patterns were identified.

## Next Steps

- Visualization using Power BI or Python (matplotlib/seaborn).
- Predictive modeling using ML (optional).
- Reporting and dashboard integration.
